# Open Mic Signup

A modern web application for managing comedy open mic signups. Built with Next.js, Supabase, and Resend.

Mostly written by AI tools, including this README! Except this line. A human wrote this line. If the rest of the README sounds a little formal, it's because a computer wrote it. I know, it's weird.

## Features

- Real-time comedian slot counter
- Sign up as either a comedian or audience member
- Email confirmation and reminder system with timezone-aware date formatting
- Easy signup cancellation via email link
- Responsive design
- Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Date-specific open mic events and signups
- Active date management system
- Encourage users to support the venue with a purchase

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openmic.git
cd openmic
npm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables in `.env.local`:
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@db.your_project_ref.supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Application Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3003
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_COMEDIAN_SLOTS=20

# Google Sheets Sync (optional)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='{ "your": "service account json" }'
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Setup

1. Create a Supabase project and get your connection string from Project Settings > Database
2. Initialize the database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

3. To import people data from a CSV file:
```bash
npm run db:import -- path/to/your/file.csv
```

The CSV should have `Name` and `Email` columns. The import will create new records for new emails and skip existing ones.

## Security Implementation

The application uses Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) with JWT authentication:

- **Open Mic Dates**: Public read access
- **People**: Public signup, protected access for personal data
- **Signups**: Public signup, protected access for personal signups

JWT tokens (5-minute lifespan) secure database operations like email validation, signup management, and cancellations.

## Email Case Sensitivity

The application handles email case sensitivity gracefully to ensure a consistent user experience. When users enter emails like `Test@example.com` vs `test@example.com`, the system treats them as the same person. This is achieved through a dual approach: emails are normalized to lowercase on the frontend before API calls (preventing future mixed-case data), while the backend uses case-insensitive database queries (`ilike`) to handle existing mixed-case data. This solution avoids the need for database migrations while ensuring both old and new users experience consistent behavior.

## Timezone Handling

The application properly handles timezone differences for date formatting in emails. Email confirmations display "tonight", "tomorrow", or specific dates based on the event's timezone rather than the server's timezone, ensuring users see accurate relative dates regardless of where the server is hosted.

## Google Sheets Integration

The application can track new comedian emails by creating date-specific Google Sheets after each open mic. This allows you to review new comedians and manually add them to your main email list.

### Setting Up Google Sheets Sync

1. **Create a Google Cloud service account:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Sheets API:
     - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
     - Search for "Google Sheets API" and click on it
     - Click "Enable"
   - Create a service account:
     - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
     - Click "Create Credentials" → "Service account"
     - Give it a name (e.g., "openmic-sheets-sync")
     - Click "Create and Continue"
     - Skip the optional permissions step (click "Continue")
     - Skip the optional user access step (click "Done")
   - Create a key for the service account:
     - Click on your new service account
     - Go to the "Keys" tab
     - Click "Add Key" → "Create new key"
     - Choose "JSON" format
     - Download the JSON file (keep this secure!)

2. **Create and configure your Google Sheet:**
   - Create a new Google Sheet
   - Add "Email" as a column header in row 1 (the script will look for this column)
   - Get the Sheet ID from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{SHEET_ID}/edit`
   - Share the sheet with your service account:
     - Click "Share" button
     - Paste the service account email (found in the JSON file as `client_email`)
     - Give it "Editor" permission
     - Click "Send"

3. **Set environment variables:**
   - Add to your `.env.local`:
     ```
     GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='{ paste contents of downloaded JSON file here }'
     GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_sheet_id_here
     ```
   - **Important:** The JSON must be on a single line. You can use a tool like `jq -c . < key.json` to compact it.
   
   - For GitHub Actions, add these as repository secrets:
     - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
     - Add `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (paste the entire JSON content)
     - Add `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`

4. **Manual sync:**
   ```bash
   npm run sync:comedians
   ```

5. **Automatic daily check:**
   - The GitHub Actions workflow runs daily at 1pm UTC (8am EST / 9am EDT)
   - It checks if there was an open mic yesterday (based on Eastern Time)
   - If yes, it creates a new sheet with any new comedian emails
   - You can also trigger it manually from the GitHub Actions tab

The sync process:
- Runs automatically the day after each open mic (or can be triggered manually)
- Checks your main Google Sheet for existing emails
- Finds any new comedian emails from last night's open mic
- Creates a new Google Sheet named "New Comedians - [date]" with only the new emails
- You can then manually review and add these to your main sheet as needed

## Deployment

The app is optimized for Vercel deployment. Just push to GitHub and import your repo in Vercel. Make sure to add all your environment variables in the Vercel project settings.
